##Documentation:


###installing buildfriend cli

```bash

$ npm install -g build-friend

```

if you want to install from github run the below command,

```bash

$ npm install -g git+https://github.com/Prashanth-Nelli/build-friend.git

```

you should have git installed in ur system.

###Sample buildfriend.js 

This file is just a quick sample to give you a taste of what build-friend does.

```javascript

var buildfriend = require('build-friend');

var gulp = require('gulp');

buildfriend.task('run',['t1','t2'],function() {
	return{
		console.log('run task is done');
	} 
});

buildfriend.task('t1',function() {
	return {
		console.log('t1 task is done');
	}
});


buildfriend.task('t2',function() {
	return{
		 console.log('t2 task is done');
	}
});

buildfriend.task('copy',function(){
	return gulp.src('./**/*.*').pipe(gulp.dest('./copy'));
});

buildfriend.task('copy2',['copy'],function(){
	return gulp.src('./copy/**/**/*.*').pipe(gulp.dest('./copy2'));
});


```
###Task dependencies execution

if task1 depends on task2 u should create task like this

```javascript

/* 
 * you should return some value otherwise buildfriend doesn't know when the task is completed
 * ,because of that depedencies may run in parallel with actual task,so to avoid that you should 
 *  return a value
 *
 */

buildfriend.task('task1',['task2'],function(){

	return {
		//task code
	}

});

```

####Watching for changes and runnig tasks 

buildfriend watch depends on [gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze)

check there for the glob patterns supported by gaze 

```javascript

/*you should pass exactly three parameters the first one is glob pattern and the second parameter
*should be an array of tasks to run on change and the thrid parameter should be a function it will
*be invoked each time there is an event like file delete,change,creat...*
*/

buildfriend.watch('./**/*.js',['task1','task2'],function(event,filepath){
	console.log(event+' '+filepath);
});


/* On every event (like file creation or deletion or updation) tasks are 
*  run in a sequencial manner like task2 will run after task1's completion
*/


```

### Running tasks 

```bash

   $ buildfriend taskname;
    
```

####Example:-

```bash

   $ buildfriend t1;

```

### plugin's and other features

Right now buildfriend doesn't have plugins specific to it but you can you gulp plugins 

as shown in the sample buildfriend.js file and there are seperate node modules for

providing minifying,compressing,jshint,copying,deleting features you can use them along with

buildfriend.

### Note

you should run your task using 
	
```bash

   $ buildfriend taskname
